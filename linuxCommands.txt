https://tldr.sh/ -> gives usage eg for commands
man     -> tells about every other command
ls -> gives list of files
ls -1 -> list files in new line
ls -l -> list files with lots of details
mkdir -> creates folders
mkdir -p "path" -> creates nested folders recursively
mkdir fold1 fold2 -> creates multiple folders in one go
cd -> change directory
rm -> removes folders which dont have files
rm -rf -> removes folders and its contents(DANGEROUS)
"cd -" -> to go to previsously chosen directory
pwd -> prints present working directory
mv file1 file2 pathToFolder -> moves selected files to given folder
cp sourceFile newFile -> creates copy of given sourceFile
cp -r sourceFolder newFolder -> creates copy of a folder with its contents recursively
touch file -> Creates and empty file. If the file already exists, it opens the file in write mode and the timestamp of the file is updated.

find command
use
-type f
to search only files, or
-type l
to only search symbolic links.
-name -> case sensitive
-iname -> case insensitive

find . -name "*.txt" -> searches for files with given extension in complete directory tree and gives there relative path
find . -type d -name "junk*" -> find directories with matching expression in current tree
find folder1 folder2 -name filename.txt -> for searching in multiple trees
find . -type d -name 

#Compressing a file
gzip file.ext -> compresses
gzip -d file.ext.gz -> decompress

## for specifiying output names
gzip -c file.ext > compressed_file.ext.gz 
gzip -c -d file.ext.gz > uncompressed_file.ext 

## for specifying level of compression
### 1 -> fastest(worst)
### 9 -> slowest(best)
gzip -9 -c file.ext > compressed_file.ext.gz

## compressing all files in a directory(DANGEROUS)
gzip -r a_folder

# tar
